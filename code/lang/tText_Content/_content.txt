**Heat**
Definition: Heat is a form of energy that is essential in the process of making glass by melting the raw materials. It causes the solid substances such as silica to transition into a liquid state, forming molten glass. The application of heat is critical to achieve the desired chemical reactions necessary for forming glass.

**Silica**
Definition: Silica, primarily in the form of silicon dioxide (SiO2), is the fundamental component of most types of glass. It acts as the glass-forming backbone when exposed to heat, solidifying into a transparent and rigid structure upon cooling. In nature, silica is commonly found in quartz and sand.

**Soda Ash**
Definition: Soda Ash, or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), is a crucial chemical used in the glass-making process. It lowers the melting point of silica, allowing the glass to form at lower temperatures. This reduction in the melting point not only saves energy but also makes the process more efficient and environmentally friendly.

**Lime**
Definition: Lime, chemically known as calcium carbonate (CaCO3), is added to the glass mixture to enhance its durability. It helps the glass resist weathering and chemical attacks once it is formed. Moreover, lime improves the viscosity and workability of molten glass
