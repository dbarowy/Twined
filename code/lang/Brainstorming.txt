        2. Parse the input 
        3. Convert the AST into DOT format suitable for Graphviz
        4. Output the DOT format to "gv.txt" 
        5. Convert the "gv.txt" to "file.svg"
        6. Opening manually "file.svg"

            Node names should correspond to folder names.
            Distinguish between Primitive Node and Combined Node.
            Syntax should include elements like nodes, hyperedges (keys for dictionary mapping),
                 maintaining consistent sets or sorted lists.
            Consider metadata or meta-circular aspects for comprehensive understanding and structure.
