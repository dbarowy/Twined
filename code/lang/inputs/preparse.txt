^^Sunlight := Sunlight provides the energy that excites electrons in chlorophyll, driving the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. This energy is crucial for splitting water molecules (photolysis), forming ATP through chemiosmosis, and generating NADPH for the Calvin cycle.^^
^^Water := Water is crucial in photosynthesis as it provides the electrons and protons needed for the light-dependent reactions. The splitting of water molecules (photolysis) supplies the electrons that drive the electron transport chain and the protons that contribute to the formation of a proton gradient for ATP synthesis.^^
^^Oxygen := Oxygen is released as a byproduct of photosynthesis when water molecules are split during photolysis. This oxygen is essential for the survival of aerobic organisms, including humans.^^
^^Soil Nutrients := Plants absorb essential nutrients from the soil, which^^
