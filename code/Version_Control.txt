TWINED LANGUAGE: PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

INSTRUCTIONS:
    This text file contains documentation comments for various files in the Twined Language Project. Each comment block
    corresponds to a specific file in the project, providing a description of its purpose and version history.
    These comments allow the tracking of changes and versions across different modules of the project.

HOW TO TRACK VERSIONS:
    1. Each comment block includes a "VERSION_X.X" section indicating the version history.
    2. Update the version number (e.g., VERSION_0.1, VERSION_1.0) in each block when making changes or adding features.
    3. Maintain a log of changes under each version number to track the evolution of the project.

VERSION_0.0

    FILE: AST.fs

        DESCRIPTION:
            This file contains the abstract syntax tree (AST) definitions used in the project. 
            The AST represents the structure of the code parsed by the parser.

        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests

    FILE: Evaluator.fs

        DESCRIPTION:
            This file contains the evaluator module responsible for interpreting and evaluating
            the AST generated by the parser. It implements the logic for executing the code
            represented by the AST nodes.

        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests

    FILE: Parser.fs

        DESCRIPTION:
            This file contains the parser module responsible for parsing input code into 
            an abstract syntax tree (AST). It defines the grammar rules and parsing logic 
            for the supported language features.

        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests

    FILE: Program.fs

        DESCRIPTION:
            This file contains the entry point and main program logic for the project. It 
            coordinates the interactions between the parser, evaluator, and other modules 
            to execute the program.
        
        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests

        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests
            - Updated type values, removed from parser

    FILE: Evaluator.fs
