TWINED LANGUAGE: PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

INSTRUCTIONS:
    This text file contains documentation comments for various files in the Twined Language Project. Each comment block
    corresponds to a specific file in the project, providing a description of its purpose and version history.
    These comments allow the tracking of changes and versions across different modules of the project.

HOW TO TRACK VERSIONS:
    1. Each comment block includes a "VERSION_X.X" section indicating the version history.
    2. Update the version number (e.g., VERSION_0.1, VERSION_1.0) in each block when making changes or adding features.
    3. Maintain a log of changes under each version number to track the evolution of the project.

VERSION_0.4

    AST.fs, Parser.fs, Evaluator.fs:
        - Changed Str to Node_name to improve readibility
    
    Parser.fs:
        - changed edge_list function to allow spaces in node names. This means that every Node_name in
        a Node_list must be followed by a ',' e.g. (bob, Nancy,) or (bob,)

    text files:
        - made changes to several for generating new graphs to include in the report

    Program.fs:
        - todo add capability to input the desired output (png, svg, etc) and name output files 

    specification.tex:
        - Finished semantics 
        - added/edited examples
        - started design principles (dont really think we need both paragraphs but they exist)
        - added a paragraph to

VERSION_0.3

    FOLDERS INPUT/OUTPUT: 

        - added folders to help with clutter, text folder holds text files that contain Graphviz
        representations of a text file
        - test holds text files with desired graphs in them
        - svg holds output from running the program

        - probably need a better system for this but for now it helps with readibility

    FILE: Parser.fs

        CHANGES:
            - added ability to have spaces in node names

        ISSUE:
            - I think that we need to adapt the parser to handle better cases of text input. Currently, 
            it can only accept input in the format: {mainEntity, (relatedEntity1, relatedEntity2, ...)}.  
            

    FILE: Program.fs

        CHANGES
            - added code that takes the name of the graphviz text file and executes it,
            stores the outcome in the svg_folder


################################################

VERSION_0.2

    FOLDER INPUT/OUTPUT: 

        IDEA:
            - Maybe we should organize user input files into a structured folder system,
              where each file's corresponding gv.txt and svg files are saved within its respective folder?

    FILE: Parser.fs

        ISSUE:
            - I think that we need to adapt the parser to handle better cases of text input. Currently, 
            it can only accept input in the format: {mainEntity, (relatedEntity1, relatedEntity2, ...)}. 
                
    FILE: Evaluator.fs

        CHANGES

            - Now, the evalExpr function recursively converts our AST into DOT language, 
              for Graphviz graph visualization by handling nodes with strings, numbers, 
              and nested expressions to create DOT-compatible edges, in the formart that the Parser
              is expecting. 
            

    FILE: Program.fs

        CHANGES
            - Once AST is evaluated, it writes to 'gv.txt'.
            - Improved error message and added user feedback for generating AST. 

################################################

VERSION_0.1

    FILE: AST.fs

        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests
            - Updated type values, removed from parser


################################################

VERSION_0.0

    FILE: AST.fs

        DESCRIPTION:
            This file contains the abstract syntax tree (AST) definitions used in the project. 
            The AST represents the structure of the code parsed by the parser.

        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests

    FILE: Evaluator.fs

        DESCRIPTION:
            This file contains the evaluator module responsible for interpreting and evaluating
            the AST generated by the parser. It implements the logic for executing the code
            represented by the AST nodes.

        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests

    FILE: Parser.fs

        DESCRIPTION:
            This file contains the parser module responsible for parsing input code into 
            an abstract syntax tree (AST). It defines the grammar rules and parsing logic 
            for the supported language features.

        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests

    FILE: Program.fs

        DESCRIPTION:
            This file contains the entry point and main program logic for the project. It 
            coordinates the interactions between the parser, evaluator, and other modules 
            to execute the program.
        
        CHANGES
            - Initial Tests
